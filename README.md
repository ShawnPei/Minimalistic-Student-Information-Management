# For this project

## Ways to run it
* You should open this FullStackManagement project by Intellij, in the right handside, click icon looks like a `m`, and in Profiles, since we are not running this in command line, ***do not choose profiles started with jib*** , 
and find `FullStackManagement/src/main/java/com/shawnpei/fullstackmanagement/FullStackManagementApplication.java`, then run it.
And then go to `FullStackManagement/src/frontend` in the ***terminal*** and run `npm start` to start the frontend.
